### [Vimeo Trailer](https://vimeo.com/386300586)


Tableau Vivant: The Living Room is a "living" painting. It is rendered in real time: sixty frames per second, twenty four hours a day, its lighting and inner life reflect the current time of day at every given moment. Inside a sparsely lit room, a rolling ocean moves agonizingly and hauntingly slow, as the painting's world slowly darkens with nightfall, mirroring our own world. Made with Blender and OpenFrameworks, this meditative piece utilizes realtime rendering, advanced fluid simulation and video blending to question and play with the passage of time, natural movement against stillness, and eternity itself.

Simulated and Rendered with [Blender 2.81](https://www.blender.org/), Coded in [OpenFrameworks 0.11](https://openframeworks.cc/).
